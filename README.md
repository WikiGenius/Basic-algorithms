# Basic-algorithms

All algorithms.
I will add the other basic algorthms From time to time.
Keep updated.

#The rcurrent algorithms in library:
 _sort:
 quickSort 
 mergeSort
 selectionSort
 insertionSort
 bubbleSort
 _search:
 bin_search

The usage:
<var> replace it with your variable.
If you want to generate new random data with any size you have date folder:

cd data/;
make all;
./generate <size_of_data>

To use the algo library

cd Basic-algorithms;
make all;
./algo <data_to_search>

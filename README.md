All algorithms.

I will add the other basic algorthms From time to time.

Keep updated.


#The current algorithms in library:

Sort:

quickSort 

mergeSort

selectionSort

insertionSort

bubbleSort

Search:

bin_search

The usage:

<var> replace it with your variable.

If you want to generate new random data with any size you have date folder:

cd data/;    make all;

./generate <size_of_data>;

To use the algo library

cd Basic-algorithms;   make all;

./algo <data_to_search> ;

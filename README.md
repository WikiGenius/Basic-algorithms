# Basic-algorithms

All algorithms.       I will add the other basic algorthms From time to time.

Keep updated.

## The current algorithms in library:

# Sort: 
```bash
quickSort
mergeSort
selectionSort
insertionSort
bubbleSort
```
#Search:
```bash
bin_search
```

Usage
=======

If you want to generate new random data with any size you have date folder:

```bash
cd data/ &&  make all;
./generate <size_of_data>;
```

## To use the algo library

```bash
cd Basic-algorithms && make all;
./algo <data_to_search> ;
```
